Revision history for Perl extension AMF::Perl.

0.15 Sun Sep 19 13:01:35 EDT 2004
Converted examples (except for Petmarket) to ActionScript 2.0 under Flash MX 2004.
Patches from Kostas Chatzikokolakis about error checking of input data length.
WriteUTF() writes the string length as long for lengths > 65535.
Also, check for (defined $s) and not just ($s) in writeUTF.

0.14 Sun Jul 11 18:59:36 EDT 2004
Really fixed the number 16 issue (forgot to include the change in 0.13).
Added Richard Boulton's change to readDouble() and writeDouble() to take into account endian-ness.
Changed the behavior of amf_throw() to enable die() to work.

0.13 Sun Jun 20 15:52:57 EDT 2004
Started duplicating changes in this file.

AMF::Perl
Made printing output a separate function, requested by Scott Penrose.
Added and exported amf_throw() that invokes _onStatus callback in Actionscript.

AMF::Perl::IO::OutputStream
Added '$s="" unless $s' in writeUTF() to avoid warnings.

AMF::Perl::IO::InputStream
Improved the check in readDouble to append "0" to the string instead of skipping
the value. Otherwise the number 16 did not go through.
Added defined($thisByte) in readInt, otherwise the character "0" (say, in string length of 30)
did not go through.

Examples / Basic 
Added a button that triggers an exception, thrown in DataEcho.pm

Examples / Petmarket
Fixed catalogservice.pm to not break when search string is not found.


0.12 Thu Apr 29 17:20:07 EDT 2004
