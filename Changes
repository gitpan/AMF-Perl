Revision history for Perl extension AMF::Perl.

0.13 Sun Jun 20 15:52:57 EDT 2004
Started duplicating changes in this file.

AMF::Perl
Made printing output a separate function, requested by Scott Penrose.
Added and exported amf_throw() that invokes _onStatus callback in Actionscript.

AMF::Perl::IO::OutputStream
Added "$s="" unless $s" in writeUTF() to avoid warnings.

Examples / Petmarket
Fixed catalogservice.pm to not break when search string is not found.

AMF::Perl::IO::InputStream
Improved the check in readDouble to append "0" to the string instead of skipping
the value. Otherwise the number 16 did not go through.
Added defined($thisByte) in readInt, otherwise the character "0" (say, in string length of 30)
did not go through.


0.12 Thu Apr 29 17:20:07 EDT 2004
AMF::Perl - changed "use Apache2" to "require Apache2".
